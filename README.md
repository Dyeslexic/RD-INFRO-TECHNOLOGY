# Cybersecurity Project

## Overview
This repository contains my completed cybersecurity awareness tasks assigned during my internship with **RD-INFRO-TECHNOLOGY**. The tasks demonstrate my ability to identify, mitigate, and educate users about various cybersecurity threats.

## Tasks Completed
- **Password Management**: Implemented guidelines on strong password creation and management.
- **Phishing Awareness**: Created detailed documentation on recognizing and preventing phishing attacks.
- **Incident Response Planning**: Developed a structured approach for handling cybersecurity incidents.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Conducted assessments to identify security weaknesses.
- **Network Segmentation**: Designed strategies to enhance network security through segmentation.
- **Penetration Testing**: Simulated cyberattacks to assess system vulnerabilities.
- **Threat Hunting**: Proactively searched for potential security threats within the system.
